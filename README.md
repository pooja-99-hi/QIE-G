## 🚩 The Problem: The Security Latency Gap
Current Web3 security is **reactive**. On a high-performance network like **QIE**, block times are sub-second. Traditional audits are static snapshots that can't track the dynamic intent of a transaction.
- **Vulnerability:** $12B+ lost to "logical" exploits that passed standard code audits.
- **The Gap:** There is no "Active Firewall" that understands *why* a transaction is happening before it hits the chain.

## 💡 The Solution: QIE Semantic Protection
QIE Guardian introduces the **QIE Semantic Intelligence Engine (QSIE)**. Unlike standard scanners, QSIE performs deep intent mapping to analyze the economic and logical consequences of transactions on the QIE Mainnet.

## 🛠️ QIE Platform Usage & Integration
This project is built from the ground up to empower the **QIE Ecosystem**:

1.  **QIE RPC Integration:** The backend maintains a persistent socket connection to QIE RPC nodes to monitor real-time block telemetry and mempool activity.
2.  **QIE EVM Optimization:** Our Semantic Engine is specifically trained on the QIE EVM specifications, identifying gas-optimization patterns and security flaws unique to the QIE environment.
3.  **QIE Validator Security Index:** We rank QIE validators not just by APY, but by a "Security Mesh Score" derived from hardware latency and slashing history on the QIE Mainnet.
4.  **Native Asset Protection:** Native support for QIE and wrapped institutional assets, providing a "Safety Index" for every token held in the QIE Vault.

## 🚀 Core Features
*   **QIE Semantic Scanner:** Instant logic-auditing for smart contracts using our proprietary QSIE engine.
*   **Real-Time TX Firewall:** Pre-execution simulation that intercepts malicious `Approve` or `Transfer` calls.
*   **Institutional Dashboard:** A high-fidelity interface for QIE asset management and global threat intelligence.
*   **Persona-Based Security:** Dynamic environments for Architects (Devs), Researchers (DeFi), and Commanders (Infrastructure).
